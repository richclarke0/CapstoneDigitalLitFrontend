# Digital Lit Testing v2.0
I'll be the first to say that this project is not my best work. It went really well at first, but I ran into a lot of issues with implementing auth using JWT tokens and getting React to behave the way I wanted to. Due to time constraints, I had to roll back my firebase backend functions to where they had no authentication, then I could finally proceed with using axios and getting react to render stuff. I also used MDBootstrap for their frontend components which saved me a bit of time writing some CSS.
